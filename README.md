Pharma Regulatory Chatbot
This project is a secure and intelligent chatbot designed to help pharmaceutical professionals quickly access and understand regulatory documents such as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), cGMP guidelines, and FDA regulations. Built using LangChain, Hugging Face embeddings, FAISS, and the Mistral-7B model hosted via Together API, the system enables real-time question-answering directly from uploaded PDF files.

Key Features:

Ask questions about SOPs, cGMP, or FDA norms in natural language

Supports multi-PDF upload with automatic parsing and cleanup

Uses vector-based semantic search (FAISS) for high-relevance document retrieval

Answers strictly based on document context using a custom prompt (RAG approach)

Organization-wide password-protected access (no user database needed)

Stylish and functional UI built with Streamlit (includes auto-scroll, chat export, and dark theme)

Designed for QA/QC teams, regulatory departments, and pharma auditors

Use Cases:

Internal SOP query resolution

Regulatory compliance audits

Onboarding or training of pharma staff

Rapid document review for QA/QC teams
